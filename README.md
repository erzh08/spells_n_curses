# Spells 'n' Curses

***Spells 'n' curses*** (pun intended) is a simple roguelike game written in C, using ncurses, and initially following [this tutorial](https://github.com/wadsworj/rogue).

## Build and run

You should have `gcc` (because `__attribute__((fallthrough))` is used), `make`, and the ncurses devel library installed.

Then you just need to type:

```console
$ make
```

to build, and run with:

```console
$ ./spells_curses
```
